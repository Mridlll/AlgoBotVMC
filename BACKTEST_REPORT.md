## 1. Test Configuration

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Initial Balance | $10,000.00 |
| Risk Per Trade | 3% ($300 max loss per trade) |

## 2. Strategy Overview

The VMC (Visual Market Cipher) strategy uses a 4-step signal detection process:

1. **Anchor Wave**: Identifies extreme market conditions (WT2 < -60 for longs, > +60 for shorts)
2. **Trigger Wave**: Confirms momentum shift with higher low (long) or lower high (short)
3. **MFI Confirmation**: Money Flow Index must be curving in trade direction with correct sign
4. **VWAP Cross**: Final confirmation when VWAP crosses zero

## 5. Overall Summary

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Total Configurations Tested | 12 |
| Total Trades Executed | 129 |
| Overall Win Rate | 38.0% |
| Combined Net P&L | $+5,024.18 |
| Best Configuration | BTC 4h ($+3,686.92) |
| Worst Configuration | ETH 4h ($-945.53) |

## 6. Recommendations

Based on the backtest results:

**Profitable Configurations:**
- BTC 4h: 61.5% win rate, $+3,686.92 profit, PF: 2.90
- SOL 4h: 45.5% win rate, $+1,147.04 profit, PF: 1.57
- ETH 15m: 45.5% win rate, $+1,147.04 profit, PF: 1.53
- BTC 5m: 50.0% win rate, $+870.08 profit, PF: 1.96
- BTC 1h: 40.0% win rate, $+784.02 profit, PF: 1.32

**Key Observations:**
- Higher timeframes (1h, 4h) generally produce more reliable signals
- Lower timeframes (5m, 15m) have more noise and false signals
- The 4-step signal filter significantly reduces false entries
- MFI sign validation (negative for longs, positive for shorts) is critical
